Alembic Database Migrations

Located at: app/core/alembic/
Configuration: alembic.ini (at project root)

## Common Commands

All commands should be run from the project root (apps/backend/):

### Create a new migration
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
```

### Apply migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback one migration
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

### View migration history
```bash
alembic history
```

### View current revision
```bash
alembic current
```

## How It Works

1. Models are automatically discovered from modules in INSTALLED_MODULES
2. Each module can have a models.py file with SQLAlchemy models
3. Alembic detects changes and generates migrations
4. Migrations are stored in app/core/alembic/versions/
